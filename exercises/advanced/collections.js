/**
 * A common asyncronous pattern:
 *   1. Run a few async tasks (read some files, send API requests, etc.)
 *   2. Collect or transform the data (parse data file, filter API response, etc.)
 *   3. Run a new async task based on the collected data (more API requests, write to file/db, etc.)
 *
 * The challenge becomes ensuring that all tasks in step 1 have completed
 * before moving onto step 2. Promises make this problem easy!
 *
 * Promise.all is a very powerful method that handles
 * a collection of async tasks with ease
 *
 * Uncomment the example and run it with `node exercises/advanced/collections.js`,
 * tinker around with the code here and/or peek under the hood at lib/asyncLib.js
 * then continue to the exercises when you're ready

  * Using Promise.all, write a function, combineFirstLineOfManyFiles, that:
  *    1. Reads each file at the path in the `filePaths` array
  *    2. Plucks the first line of each file
  *    3. Joins each first line into a new file
  *      - The lines should be in the same order with respect to the input array
  *      - i.e. the second line in the new file should be the first line of `filePaths[1]`
  *    4. Writes the new file to the file located at `writePath`
  *
  * Make sure combineFirstLineOfManyFiles returns a promise so the following will work:
  *
  * combineFirstLineOfManyFiles(someFiles, someWritePath)
  *   .then(function() {
  *     // Any work done here is guaranteed to occur **after**
  *     // the new file has been successfully written
  *   })
